# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains Python implementations of popular machine learning algorithms without using external libraries for core functionality. 
The purpose of this project is to provide a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts and algorithms behind machine learning.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Linear Regression**: Implementation of simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.

2. **Decision Tree**: A basic decision tree classifier and regressor.

3. **K-Means Clustering**: A simple implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm.

4. **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier for text classification.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/om9011/Machine_Learning.git


2. Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- **Python**: You should have Python 3.9 or above installed on your machine.

- **Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab)**: The project is designed to be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment. You can also use Google Colab for a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook experience. You can install Jupyter Notebook or Use Colab
